### üìÖ April 14, 2025: S√©bastien Heurtematte on facilitating CRA compliance for SMEs with OCCTET

S√©bastien Heurtematte will be joining us to tell us more about OCCTET, an EU-funded initiative aimed at improving the cybersecurity and CRA compliance of SMEs. He'll also share with us the initial report on a survey OCCTET has been running with SMEs and open source stewards to learn more about their concerns when it comes to CRA compliance. 

#### Our guest
**S√©bastien Heurtematte**, member of the Eclipse Foundation, is the coordinator of the OCCTET project, leading a consortium of 7 partners across Europe working to make Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) compliance simpler and more accessible for SMEs. With a strong technical background in open source, release engineering, and supply chain, he brings years of experience simplifying complex processes and addressing security challenges. Passionate about collaboration and accessibility, he focuses on making CRA compliance practical and approachable for both open source projects and SMEs.
