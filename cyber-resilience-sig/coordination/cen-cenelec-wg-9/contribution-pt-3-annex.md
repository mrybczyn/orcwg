# Contribution to CEN/CENELEC WG 9 PT 3 Vulnerability Handling Standard Annex on Open Source Stewards

## Request

Provide the content for the **informative** section on open source software stewards (Annex C).

## Context

- This is the standard for vulnerability handling covering the requirements defined in [Annex I, Part II](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#anx_I) of the CRA.
- The standard only focuses on what's in this annex of the CRA, not any other obligations.
- The standard is aimed at manufacturers, not stewards.
- The section we're asked to contribute too is _informative_ (not _normative_), which means it doesn't create any requirements for anybody; it's just there to provide context.
- The section *should not reword the CRA content*, including what stewards are.

## Proposed abstract of the submission

The annex explains to manufacturers what they should know when interacting with open source projects during vulnerability handling. That includes a brief discussion of various types of open source projects (with and without stewards). The section should also describe what open source project expect from manufacturers in terms of submitted information and patches (of fixed vulnerabilities) and what manufacturers can expect from stewards and open source projects. The section will also include the typical CVD process followed by open source and information on typical ways to learn about the process of a specific project.
