# Contribution to CEN/CENELEC WG 9 PT 3 Vulnerability Handling Standard Annex on Open Source

## Request

Provide the content for the **informative** section on open source software stewards (Annex C).

> [!WARNING]
> There is a misconception, even from PT 3, that manufacturers will only interface with open source software stewards when dealing with open source software. This obvioulsy isn't the case: many—if not most—open source projects will not have stewards. We need to work with PT 3 to rename the annex and reframe the request to include all open source projects (and not just the subset that will have stewards).

## Context

- This is the standard for vulnerability handling covering the _essential requirements_ defined in [Annex I, Part II](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#anx_I) of the CRA.
- The standard only focuses on those _essential requirements_, not on any other obligations.
- The standard is aimed at manufacturers, not stewards.
- The section we're asked to contribute too is _informative_ (not _normative_), which means it doesn't create any requirements for anybody; it's just there to provide context.
- The section *should not reword the CRA content*, including what stewards are.
- The sections should cover only vulnerability management for now.

## Goals

The goals for the document as listed in the call for contributions are:

> We are looking not only for comments but for actual contributions to creating a section that can help:
> — Manufacturers need to understand the interactions with open-source stewards better.
> — Allowing the open source community to have a better overview of this role introduced within the CRA legal text.
> — Make explicit the relation with this actual standard and what is expected and reasonable for this type of economic operator.
>

The goals from the community are:
- Explain to manufacturers how their interactions will like with open source projects (ones with and without stewards) during various parts of the vulnerability management process
- Help better communication by explaining what manufacturers should and shouldn't expect from open source projects

## Proposed abstract of the submission

The annex explains to manufacturers what they should know when interacting with open source projects during vulnerability handling. That includes a brief discussion of various types of open source projects (with and without stewards). The section should also describe what open source project expect from manufacturers in terms of submitted information and patches (of fixed vulnerabilities) and what manufacturers can expect from stewards and open source projects. The section will also include the typical CVD process followed by open source and information on typical ways to learn about the process of a specific project.
